# Double the Number Program üßÆ

## Description
This is a simple Python program that asks the user to input a number, and then doubles that number until the result is greater than or equal to 100. The program will print out the result after each doubling. 

The program uses a while loop to continuously double the number, and prints the results in a visually engaging way using colors with the `termcolor` library. It also includes error handling for invalid user inputs (non-integer values).

## Features
- **Interactive User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter a number.
- **Doubles the Number**: The program repeatedly doubles the number and prints the result.
- **User-Friendly Output**: The results are printed in a visually distinct color.
- **Error Handling**: The program catches and handles errors like invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric characters).

## Usage

1. **Run the program**: 
   You will be asked to enter a number.
   
2. **Program Behavior**:
   - If you enter a valid number, it will print the doubled value each time, until it reaches or exceeds 100.
   - If you enter a non-integer value, it will inform you about the invalid input and ask for a valid number.
