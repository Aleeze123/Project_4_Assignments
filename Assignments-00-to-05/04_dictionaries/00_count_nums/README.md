## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run the Program**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where the program is saved, and run the following command:

    ```bash

    ```

2. **Input Numbers**:

    Keep entering numbers. When you're finished, just hit **Enter** without typing any number (a blank line) to stop.

    Enter a number: 5
    Enter a number: 10
    Enter a number: 5
    Enter a number: 20
    Enter a number: 5
    Enter a number: 

    5 appears 3 times.
    10 appears 1 times.
    20 appears 1 times.
