# Chaotic Counting Program 🧮

This is a Python program that counts from 1 to 10, with a random stop mechanism integrated. It uses the `termcolor` library to colorize the text output for better visualization. 🎨

## Program Flow 🚶‍♂️

- The program prints a message indicating that it will count until 10 or until it decides to stop randomly. 🛑
- The numbers from 1 to 10 are printed, each in green. 💚
- At any point, the program may stop counting, determined by a random probability (`DONE_LIKELIHOOD`). 🎲
- Once the counting is finished, either due to reaching 10 or a random stop, a message "I'm done" is printed in blue. 🔵

## Dependencies 📦

- `termcolor`: A library for coloring text output in the terminal. 🌈
- `random`: Standard Python library for generating random numbers. 🔢
