## üî• Features

- **Colorful Output**: 
  - The greeting message is displayed in **cyan**.
  - The input prompt is displayed in **yellow**.
  - Leap year results are shown in **green** if the year is a leap year, and **red** if it is not.
  
- **Leap Year Calculation**: 
  The program checks if the input year is a leap year by applying the following criteria:
  1. The year must be divisible by 4.
  2. If divisible by 100, the year must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
  
- **Simple Interface**: The user simply needs to input a year, and the program will immediately tell them whether it's a leap year or not.
