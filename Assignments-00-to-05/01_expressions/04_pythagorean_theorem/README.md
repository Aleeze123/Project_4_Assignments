# üìê Pythagorean Theorem Program by Aleeza

Welcome to the **Pythagorean Theorem Program**! This Python program allows users to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle when the lengths of the two perpendicular sides are provided. The program demonstrates the famous **Pythagorean Theorem** using Python and includes colorful inputs and outputs for a better user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To run this program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aleeze123/Project_4_Assignments.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    This program uses the `termcolor` library for colorful output. Install it by running:

    ```bash
    pip install termcolor
    ```

    The `termcolor` library is not part of Python's standard library, so make sure you have it installed.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Run the Program**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where the program is saved, and run the program with the following command:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Enter the Side Lengths**:
    You will be prompted to enter the lengths of the two perpendicular sides (AB and AC) of a right triangle.

    Example:
    ```
    Enter the length of side AB: 3
    Enter the length of side AC: 4
    ```

3. **View the Hypotenuse**:
    After entering the side lengths, the program will calculate and display the length of the hypotenuse (BC).

    Example Output:
    ```
    The length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: 5.0
    ```

4. **Input Validation**:
    If you enter an invalid input (such as non-numeric values), the program will ask you to input valid numbers.

    Example:
    ```
    ‚ùå Invalid input! Please enter valid numbers for the sides.
    ```

5. **End of Program**:
    After displaying the result, the program will thank the user for using it.

    Example:
    ```
    Thank you for using the Pythagorean Theorem Program!
    ```
