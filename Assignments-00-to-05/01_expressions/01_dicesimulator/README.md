# üé≤ Dice Simulator Program by Aleeza

Welcome to the **Dice Simulator Program**! This Python program simulates rolling two dice three times and prints the results of each roll. It demonstrates how variables and their scope work within a function. The program also showcases how a variable defined in one function (like `main()`) does not affect the execution of another function (`roll_dice()`).

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Run the Program**:
    Launch the program by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
