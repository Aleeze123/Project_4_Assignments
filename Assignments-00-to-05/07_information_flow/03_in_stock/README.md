# Fruit Store Inventory Checker 🍏🍍

Aleeza owns a fruit store and wants to manage her inventory. This Python program helps her check how many of a particular fruit are in stock. The program prompts the user for a fruit and prints the number of that fruit in stock if it's available, or prints a message saying the fruit is not in stock.

## Program Features ✨

- **User Input**: The user is prompted to enter the name of a fruit.
- **Stock Check**: The program checks how many of that fruit are available in Sophia's inventory.
- **Colorized Output**: The program uses `termcolor` to print the messages in different colors for a better user experience:
  - **Green**: If the fruit is in stock, it displays the message with the number of items.
  - **Red**: If the fruit is not in stock, it prints a message saying so.
  - **Blue**: The number of items in stock is printed in blue.
