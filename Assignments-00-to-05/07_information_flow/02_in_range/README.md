# Number Range Checker 🔢

This Python program checks if a given number falls within a specified range. It takes three integer inputs from the user: a number and a range (low and high). It then checks if the number is between the low and high values (inclusive). The program uses the `termcolor` library to colorize the input and output messages for a better user experience.

## Program Features ✨

- **Range Check**: The program verifies if the given number is within a specified range.
- **Colorized Output**: The program uses `termcolor` to display the input prompts in **yellow**, and the output messages in either **green** (if the number is within the range) or **red** (if the number is outside the range).

## Dependencies 📦

- `termcolor`: A Python library for coloring text in the terminal. 🌈
