# Bulk File Renamer Python Project üîÑ

This project demonstrates how to build a Python program that can go into any folder on your computer and rename all of the files based on custom conditions. The program uses Python's **`os`** module to handle file operations and **`termcolor`** to add color to the output for a more interactive experience.

## Features üåü
- Renames multiple files in a folder based on a set condition.
- Uses the **`os`** module to interact with the file system.
- Provides **colorful terminal output** using the **`termcolor`** module for better user experience.
