# Binary Search Python Project üîç

In this project, we implement the **Binary Search** algorithm, which is a common searching algorithm. It is often used in job interviews and competitive programming challenges, making it an essential concept to master.

This implementation uses **Python** and leverages the **`termcolor`** module to add color to the terminal output for better clarity and interaction.

## Features üåü
- Efficient **Binary Search** algorithm implementation.
- Colorful console outputs using **`termcolor`** for easy debugging and visualization.
- The binary search works on a **sorted array** to find the position of a target element.
