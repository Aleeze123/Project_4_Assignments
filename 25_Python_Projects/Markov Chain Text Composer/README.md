# Markov Chain Text Composer 📝🤖

This project demonstrates the power of the **Markov Chain** model for text generation using Python. It's a great introduction to **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** concepts, specifically how a Markov Chain can be applied to generate new, random text based on a given input.

## Features ✨
- Generates text based on a Markov chain model using n-grams.
- Input text can be any form of writing (song lyrics, poetry, or prose).
- Uses the `termcolor` library to display the generated text in color 🌈.
- Easy to customize for different types of text or creative writing.
