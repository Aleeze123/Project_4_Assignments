# Computer Guess the Number Game üéÆ

This project is a Python implementation of a number guessing game where the **computer** attempts to guess a number that the **user** thinks of. The game uses Python's `random` module to make guesses and provides feedback to the computer based on the user's input. Additionally, the `termcolor` module is used to add color to the console output for a more engaging experience.
