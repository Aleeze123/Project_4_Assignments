# Tic-Tac-Toe AI 🎮

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe AI** game! This is a Python-based implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where the computer plays optimally using the **Minimax Algorithm**. The AI never loses and either wins or draws the game. 🧠🤖

## Features ✨
- **Optimal AI**: The computer (Player O) uses the **Minimax algorithm** to always make the best move, ensuring it never loses. 🏆
- **Two Players**: You play as **Player X** against the computer (Player O). 🤝
- **Colorful Output**: The board and game messages are printed with colorful output using the `termcolor` library. 🌈
- **Game Flow**: The game alternates turns between **Player X** and **Computer (Player O)**.
